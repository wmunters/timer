# timer
Conference timer originally designed for the Windfarms2015 conference by Wim Munters. 

Conference program has been hardcoded into the timer, but can be changed with relative ease in the conference.py script. 

On systems with a Python installation including the Tinker modules, the gui can be run by executing the gui.py script.
Moreover, the gui.exe executable in the dist subfolder has been compiled with py2exe and can be run on any Windows computer without the need to install Python interpreters.
